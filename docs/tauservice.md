## Service Unit Files

### File Format
TauService uses TOML-based unit files with `.tau` extension, similar to systemd's `.service` files but with a cleaner syntax.

### Unit File Structure

#### Basic Service Unit
```toml
name = "my-service"
description = "My custom service"

[service]
exec_start = "/usr/bin/my-service"
exec_stop = "/usr/bin/my-service --stop"
restart = "always"
user = "myuser"
group = "mygroup"
working_directory = "/var/lib/my-service"

environment = { "DEBUG" = "true", "PORT" = "8080" }
environment_file = ["/etc/my-service/env.conf"]

standard_output = "journal"
standard_error = "journal"

[sandbox]
read_write_paths = ["/var/log/my-service", "/var/cache/my-service"]
read_only_paths = ["/etc/my-service"]
no_new_privileges = true
private_tmp = true
network_access = true

[install]

    ‚Üì         ‚Üì         ‚Üì
Deactivating ‚Üê Failed ‚Üê Reloading
```

- **Activating**: Service is starting up
- **Active**: Service is running normally
- **Deactivating**: Service is shutting down
- **Failed**: Service failed to start or crashed
- **Reloading**: Service is reloading configuration

## Logging System

### Journal Structure
```
/var/log/tau/journal/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nginx.log
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sshd.log
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my-service.log
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Log Format
```
2024-01-01 12:00:00 [STDOUT] INFO: Server started on port 8080
2024-01-01 12:00:01 [STDERR] WARNING: Configuration file not found
2024-01-01 12:00:02 [SYSTEM] ERROR: Failed to bind to port 8080
```

### Log Levels
- **DEBUG**: Detailed debugging information
- **INFO**: General information messages
- **WARNING**: Warning messages
- **ERROR**: Error messages
- **CRITICAL**: Critical error messages

## Boot Integration

### Boot Targets
TauService creates a target system similar to systemd:

- **boot.target**: Initial boot target
- **multi-user.target**: Multi-user system target
- **network.target**: Network services target
- **graphical.target**: Graphical interface target

### Boot Process
1. System boots and starts `boot.target`
2. `boot.target` starts basic services
3. `multi-user.target` starts user services
4. Services marked with `wanted_by = ["multi-user.target"]` start automatically

### Persistent State
Service states are saved in `/var/lib/tau-service/state.json`:
- Enabled/disabled status
- Last known state
- Restart counts
- Timestamps

## Security Features

### Sandboxing
Services can be sandboxed with various restrictions:

```toml
[sandbox]
# Filesystem restrictions
read_write_paths = ["/var/log/my-app"]
read_only_paths = ["/etc/my-app"]
private_tmp = true

# Security restrictions
no_new_privileges = true
private_devices = true
network_access = false

# Capabilities
capabilities = ["CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE"]
```

### Security Profiles
TauService supports AppArmor and SELinux profiles:

```bash
# Create security profile
tau-service security create-profile my-service

# Audit service security
tau-service security audit my-service
```

### Security Auditing
The security auditor provides comprehensive analysis:

```bash
# Get security report
tau-service security report nginx
```

## TauPkg Integration

### Package Hooks
When packages are installed via TauPkg, they can automatically register services:

```bash
# Install package with services
tau-pkg install nginx

# Services are automatically registered
tau-service list
# Shows: nginx.service

# Services can be auto-enabled
tau-service taupkg auto-enable nginx
```

### Package Service Discovery
TauService automatically discovers services in packages:

```bash
# List services provided by package
tau-service taupkg list-services my-package

# Install hooks for package
tau-service taupkg install-hooks my-package /path/to/package
```

## Advanced Features

### Dependency Resolution
TauService automatically resolves service dependencies:
```toml
# Service A depends on B and C
[unit]
requires = ["service-b", "service-c"]
after = ["service-b", "service-c"]
```

### Circular Dependency Detection
TauService prevents circular dependencies:
```bash
# This would fail with circular dependency error
tau-service start service-a
# Error: Circular dependency detected for service: service-a
```

### Service Health Monitoring
TauService monitors service health and restarts failed services:
```bash
# Check service health
tau-service status my-service

# View restart history
tau-service logs my-service | grep "restart"
```

### Performance Monitoring
TauService tracks service performance:
```bash
# View service statistics
tau-service state summary

# Check service uptime
tau-service status my-service
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Service Won't Start
```bash
# Check service status
tau-service status my-service

# View service logs
tau-service logs my-service

# Check unit file syntax
tau-service daemon-reload
```

#### Service Keeps Restarting
```bash
# Check restart count
tau-service status my-service

# View recent logs
tau-service logs my-service --lines 100

# Check dependencies
tau-service list --running
```

#### Permission Issues
```bash
# Check user/group settings
cat /etc/tau/services/my-service.tau

# Verify file permissions
ls -la /usr/bin/my-service
```

#### Boot Issues
```bash
# Check boot integration
tau-service boot list

# Verify boot services
tau-service boot start

# Check system targets
ls -la /etc/tau/system/
```

### Debugging Commands
```bash
# Enable verbose logging
tau-service start my-service --verbose

# Check daemon status
tau-service daemon-reload

# View all service logs
tau-service logs my-service --follow

# Security audit
tau-service security audit my-service
```

### Log Locations
- **Service Logs**: `/var/log/tau/journal/`
- **State Files**: `/var/lib/tau-service/`
- **Configuration**: `/etc/tau/services/`
- **Boot Files**: `/etc/tau/system/`

## Performance Considerations

### Resource Usage
- **Memory**: ~2MB base memory usage
- **CPU**: Minimal overhead for service management
- **Disk**: Log files can grow, use log rotation
- **Network**: No network usage unless configured

### Optimization Tips
- Use `type = "simple"` for most services
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies
- Use `restart = "no"` for one-shot services
- Configure appropriate timeouts
- Use sandboxing for security and performance
