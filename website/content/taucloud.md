## 🗂️ File Explorer + Cloud in One
Manage files locally or in your encrypted TauCloud account. No more switching between different apps or services — everything you need is in one beautiful, unified interface that feels natural and intuitive.

## 🔐 End-to-End Encryption
Every file is protected before it leaves your device. Whether you're storing documents, photos, or sensitive work files, TauCloud ensures that your data remains private and secure, even from the service itself.

## 🧠 Smart Privacy Labels
Instantly see which files are public, private, or shared. TauCloud's intelligent labeling system helps you maintain control over your digital footprint, making it easy to understand and manage your data's privacy level at a glance.

## 🖱️ GUI-Based Drag & Drop
Intuitive design, no CLI needed. TauCloud makes file management as simple as it should be — drag files between folders, upload to cloud storage, or share with others, all through beautiful, responsive interfaces.

## 🧩 Works with Tau Apps
Seamlessly syncs with TauMail, Tau Media, and more. Your files are accessible across all TauOS applications, creating a unified digital experience where everything works together harmoniously.

## 📦 Backup & Restore
One-click backup of your entire system. TauCloud makes it easy to protect your digital life, with automated backups that respect your privacy while ensuring your data is always safe and recoverable.

## Why TauCloud?

In an era where your files are stored on servers you don't control, accessed by algorithms you don't understand, and potentially viewed by people you don't know, TauCloud represents a fundamental shift in how we think about digital storage.

### Privacy by Design
TauCloud doesn't just encrypt your files — it encrypts them in a way that even we can't access. Your data belongs to you, and only you. No backdoors, no government access, no corporate surveillance.

### Simplicity by Choice
We believe powerful features shouldn't require complex interfaces. TauCloud offers enterprise-grade security and functionality through interfaces that feel natural and effortless to use.

### Integration by Default
TauCloud isn't a separate service — it's part of your operating system. This deep integration means better performance, tighter security, and a more cohesive user experience.
