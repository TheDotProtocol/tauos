# Tau Store

Apps you need. Privacy you deserve.

Tau Store is your official marketplace for apps, tools, themes, and updates — all curated to meet the TauOS standard of privacy-first and zero-bloat.

## 🚫 No Ads. No Trackers. No Spyware.
Every app in the Tau Store is vetted for security, usability, and respect for user data. We believe your app store shouldn't be a surveillance tool — it should be a trusted gateway to software that works for you.

## 🧠 Smart Categories
From productivity tools to creative suites, AI assistants to blockchain wallets — everything is organized and accessible in one click. Find what you need quickly, discover new tools easily, and explore categories that make sense for real people with real needs.

## 🎨 Themes & Customization
Switch up your entire OS look with custom icon packs, UI themes, and animations — all drag-and-drop ready. TauOS is beautiful by default, but it's also infinitely customizable. Make it yours, without compromising on performance or security.

## 📦 One-Click Installs
No sudo. No scripts. Just tap, install, and go. All apps are GUI-optimized for TauOS, ensuring that every piece of software you install feels native and integrated with your system.

## 🔄 Automatic Updates, Manual Control
You stay in control. Choose when and how to update your system or apps — nothing runs without your permission. Tau Store respects your autonomy while keeping your software secure and up-to-date.

## 🧰 Developer-Friendly
Open-source devs can publish directly to Tau Store with our upcoming TauDev Portal — build beautiful, secure apps for a real community. We believe in empowering developers to create software that respects users and enhances their digital lives.

## 🔐 Verified by TauSec
Every app is audited by our internal security layer (TauSec) and labeled:

### ✅ Verified Open Source
Transparent, auditable code that you can trust and verify yourself.

### 🛡️ Privacy-Certified
Apps that respect your data and don't track your behavior.

### ⚠️ Needs Review (with full transparency)
Apps that require additional scrutiny, with clear explanations of why and what we're doing about it.

## Why Tau Store?

Tau Store is more than an app marketplace — it's a trust layer between you and your software. In a world where app stores are increasingly becoming surveillance platforms, Tau Store represents a fundamental shift in how we think about software distribution.

### Privacy by Default
Every app in Tau Store is evaluated not just for functionality, but for its commitment to user privacy. We believe software should serve you, not spy on you.

### Quality by Design
We don't just curate apps — we ensure they meet our standards for performance, security, and user experience. Every app in Tau Store is tested and verified to work seamlessly with TauOS.

### Community by Choice
Tau Store isn't just a marketplace — it's a community of developers, users, and advocates who believe in privacy-first computing. Join us in building a better digital future.
